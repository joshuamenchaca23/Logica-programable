# Verilog Class Work

This repository contains my Verilog HDL assignments and practice projects developed during my university course on Digital Logic and FPGA Design.

The projects focus on implementing combinational and sequential digital systems using hardware description languages and deploying them on FPGA development boards.

## Course Overview
---

This course introduces the fundamentals of digital design using **Verilog HDL**.  
Throughout the semester, different projects are developed to understand:

- Combinational logic design  
- Sequential logic systems  
- Finite State Machines (FSM)  
- FPGA synthesis and implementation  
- Simulation and waveform analysis  

All designs are tested through simulation and later implemented on FPGA hardware.

The repository is organized into assignment folders.  
Each folder may include:

- Verilog source files (.v)
- Testbenches
- Simulation waveform files (.vcd)
- Compiled simulation outputs
- Quartus project files
